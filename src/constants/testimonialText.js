        quotation: "I very much enjoyed my visits to Montreal and CUSEC. It was a pleasant change to attend a conference where I was not being sold a product but rather actually got to hear about real world issues in Software Engineering and to meet Canadians. I look forward to the time when I can get back there. I would really enjoy being a presenter again.",
